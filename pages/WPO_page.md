## [Projects](/index.md) / Oil Field Development and Planning

**Project description:** This project examines introducing a problem-specific Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal well placement in oil fields. The outcome of this project is a framework that improves the convergence rate to the optimal solution, while maintianing a relativly less computational cost.
